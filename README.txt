Automated calcium data interpretation project.

This is a python project which allows us to interpret the data generated from a series of experements which measured
cellular calcium during ionomycin treatment. Ionomycin treatment causes an influx in cellular calcium which is then
cleared. The aim of this project was the automate the process of determining the rate of calcium clearence (reduction
in cellular calcium after ionomycin treatment). This rate can then be compared between disease and WT cells.

To run:

1 - Open calcium_with_assessment_annotation.ipynb file in a jupyter notebook browser.
2 - Insert the URL of data to test.
	Example data - 'https://github.com/U1711/calcium_project/blob/main/Fucosidosis%20A%2013032018.csv'
3 - Run through data in order and follow annotations.
	One point requires going back and running a previous cell, but this is specified in annotation.

Thank you!
